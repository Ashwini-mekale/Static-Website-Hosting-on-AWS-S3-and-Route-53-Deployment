# Introduction to AWS Hosting
## Overview of AWS:
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform that offers over 200 fully-featured services from data centers globally. These services include computing power, storage options, networking, databases, machine learning, and more. AWS enables businesses of all sizes to scale their operations, innovate rapidly, and reduceIT costs. Whether you’re a startup building your first web app or an enterprise running mission-critical workloads, AWS provides the tools and infrastructure needed to succeed in the cloud.

## Why Use S3 and Route 53?
Simplicity: Quick to set up and manage, ideal for hosting static websites with minimal effort.
Scalability & Reliability: Automatically handles traffic spikes, ensuring high availability with AWS's robust global infrastructure.<br><br>


# Understanding Static Websites
Static websites deliver pre-built content to users without any changes unless manually updated. Each webpage is a fixed HTML file served directly to the user’s browser. Since no server-side processing is required, the content remains consistent for all users. This simplicity makes static websites faster to load and easier to manage, as they don’t rely on databases or server-side scripting.

Dynamic websites, in contrast, generate content dynamically based on user interactions, database queries, or other factors. When a user requests a page, the server processes scripts and pulls data from databases to create the content on the fly, allowing for personalized and interactive experiences.

## Why Choose a Static Website?
Static websites are ideal for projects that don’t require frequent content changes. They provide faster load times, lower hosting costs, and simpler deployment processes, making them well-suited for portfolios, landing pages, and informational sites.

## Comparison with Dynamic Websites:
|**Feature**|**Static Websites**|**Dynamic Websites**|
| ------------| ------------------- | -------------------- |
|**content**| Fixed, manual updates | Generated on-the-fly |
|**Performance**| Faster, no processing needed | Slower due to server-side processing |
|**Complexity**| Simple, no backend needed | Complex, requires backend and databases |
|**Scalability**| Easy to scale | Requires more infrastructure planning |

## Key Features:
Domain Registration: Register new domains or transfer existing ones.
DNS Management: Reliable and low-latency DNS service for routing traffic efficiently.
Health Checks: Monitors the health of your resources and routes traffic based on availability<br><br>


# Step 1: Register a custom domain with Route 53

- Access AWS Management Console: Log in and navigate to the Route 53 service to start managing your domains.

- Select "Registered Domains": This option allows you to view and manage your existing domains or register new ones.

## Register or Transfer Domain:
- Register Domain: Click on “Register Domain” to choose and purchase a new domain.
- Transfer Domain: Alternatively, select “Transfer Domain” to move an existing domain to Route 53.<br><br>


# Step 4: Linking Domain to S3 Bucket
## 1. Create DNS Records:
## 2. Add A Record:
- Open Route 53 Console: Go to the Route 53 dashboard.
- Select Hosted Zone: Choose the hosted zone for your domain.
- Create Record Set: Add an A record pointing to the S3 bucket endpoint.
## 3. Use Alias Record:
- Alias Setup: Create an alias record that maps your domain directly to the S3 bucket, allowing it to handle the traffic.
